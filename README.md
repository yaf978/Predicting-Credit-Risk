## Prediction
The Logistic regression will be more accurate because the data is imbalanced and because the logistic regressions Path analysis approach, uses a generalized linear equation to describe the directed dependencies among a set of variables.

## Logistic regression

## Comparison and Conclusion
both ways give a high testing score with slight differences to the Logistic Regression Model favor.

LogisticRegression Testing Data Score:0.9924680148576145.

Random_Forest Testing Score: 0.991900536524969
